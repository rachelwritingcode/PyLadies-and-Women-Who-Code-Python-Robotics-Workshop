# PyLadies & Women Who Code Collaboration üéâ
## üêç Python for Robotics Workshop (On the Raspberry Pi) ü•ß

- This workshop was hosted at the University of Toronto Department of Computer Science Innovation Lab, it is designed for the PyLadies and Women Who Code communities. 

### What is it? 

- Using Python we created a workshop which guides attendees to their first lines of python code for robotics using the Raspberry Pi microcomputer.
- We taught users basic python commands which can be used to control hardware input and output on the Raspberry Pi.
- Hardware pieces attached to the Raspberry Pi included were a servo motor `new_servo.py`, LED light `new_blink.py` and motion sensor `new_sensor.py`.
